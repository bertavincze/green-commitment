/**
 * The server application is responsible for accepting/reading and accumulating data-points sent by the client applications.
 * Can have more than 1 client. Multiple client applications can connect the server, each acts as a different sensor.
 * The server collects data over time from every sensor that connects to it.
 * The server stores collected data in an XML file. The file is only updated when the user exits the server application
 * (until then the server collects data in memory).
 * While the server's running the user of the application has the option to generate a chart (image) from the data
 * collected so far. Users are able to select which sensor's data to use to generate the chart. The generated chart
 * should be saved in a directory/file specified by the user. The chart has two axes, time and measured value.
 * In the case of a thermometer measured value is in celsius degrees, in the case of a water level detector
 * it's in meters or centimeters, etc.
